Think Instagram's core experience, built natively in SwiftUI.\n\nHere's what's been built:\n\n### ✅ What's in the app now:\n- **Home feed** — Scrollable vertical feed with posts, avatars, like/comment/share/bookmark actions, like counts, and timestamps\n- **Stories row** — Horizontal scrollable story bubbles with gradient ring borders, a \"Your Story\" add button, and username labels\n- **Post cards** — Full-width square images, captions, verified badges, post headers with author info and overflow menu\n- **Post actions** — Tap-to-like (fills red), bookmark toggle, comment and share buttons\n- **Tab navigation** — Home, Reels, Create, Explore, and Profile tabs with white icon styling\n- **Cached image loading** — Async image loading with a reusable `CachedImageView`\n- **Dark theme** — Pure black background with white typography and subtle dividers, matching Instagram's aesthetic\n\n### 🚀 Suggested next steps:\n1. **Build Reels** — Full-screen vertical video feed with auto-play and swipe navigation\n2. **Build Explore** — Search bar, trending grid, and topic filters\n3. **Create/upload flow** — Photo picker, filters, and caption editor\n4. **Profile screen** — Grid of posts, follower/following counts, bio, and edit profile\n5. **Connect a backend** — Real user accounts, follows, likes, and comments via API" }
