  { "role": "assistant", "content": "The app is live and looking great! **ChatGPT-style** — an AI chat app powered by Apple Intelligence, with conversation history, a Pro paywall, and Supabase backend integration. Built natively in SwiftUI.\n\nHere's what's been built:\n\n### ✅ What's in the app now:\n- **Main chat view** — Clean white chat interface with a logo animation and AI availability badge on the empty state, prompt example chips to quick-start conversations, streaming message bubbles that update word-by-word as the AI responds\n- **Input bar** — Multi-line text input with a loading spinner during AI generation and send-on-submit\n- **Model selector** — Navigation bar dropdown to switch between AI models (Apple Intelligence default)\n- **Sidebar overlay** — Slide-in history panel with a full conversation list, model label per chat, user footer with avatar, and an \"Upgrade to Pro\" card for free users\n- **Paywall screen** — Dark purple gradient paywall with Pro feature list (unlimited messages, all models, image generation, priority speed) and restore purchases\n- **Apple Intelligence integration** — `AppleIntelligenceService` for on-device AI with async streaming\n- **Local storage** — `LocalStorageService` persists conversations and messages on-device\n- **Supabase client** — Ready for cloud sync and user auth\n- **RevenueCat** — Subscription state management wired up for Pro gating\n- **Purple gradient theme** — `#6C5CE7` to `#A855F7` accent on badges, upgrade card, and paywall\n\n### 🚀 Suggested next steps:\n1. **Connect OpenAI or Anthropic API** — Replace Apple Intelligence with a cloud LLM for broader availability\n2. **Enable Supabase auth** — Sign in with Apple/email and sync conversations to the cloud\n3. **Activate RevenueCat IAP** — Wire up the Pro paywall to real App Store subscriptions\n4. **Add image generation** — DALL·E or Stable Diffusion integration as a Pro feature\n5. **Build Settings** — Model preferences, theme toggle, and account management" }
